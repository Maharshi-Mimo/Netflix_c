# Netflix_c
This project is a simple clone of the Netflix.com page. The motivation behind this project is to have hands on experience with DevSecOps tools and processes and also to practice different react properties and features.

# Deploy Netflix Clone on Cloud

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Deployment**

**Step 1: Launch EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04):**

- Provision an EC2 instance on AWS with Ubuntu 22.04.
- Connect to the instance using SSH.

**Step 2: Clone the Code:**

- Update all the packages and then clone the code.
- Clone your application's code repository onto the EC2 instance:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/N4si/DevSecOps-Project.git
    ```

**Step 3: Install Docker and Run the App Using a Container:**

- Set up Docker on the EC2 instance:
    
    ```bash
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  # Replace with your system's username, e.g., 'ubuntu'
    newgrp docker
    sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
    ```
